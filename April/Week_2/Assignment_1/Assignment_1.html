    <h1>Web Technologies :-</h1>
    <h2>HTML -</h2>
    <p>
      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
      tags, written using angle brackets.
    </p>

    <h2>CSS -</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed
      language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
      CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables
      you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. CSS is
      easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the
      presentation of an HTML document.
    </p>

    <p>
      CSS saves time: You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in
      multiple HTML pages. Easy Maintenance: To make a global change simply
      change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated
      automatically. Search Engines: CSS is considered a clean coding technique,
      which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
    </p>

    <h2>Java Script -</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting
      language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many
      non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for
      Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.JavaScript
      contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a
      core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and
      statements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document
      Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to
      place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
      clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the
      client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
      server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to
      communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from
      one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
      manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous
      these days is node.js.
    </p>

    <p>
      History of JavaScript: It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was
      an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript
      but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript
      language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a
      scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host
      environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside
      world. The most common host environment is the browser.
